      Anthonie Owen is a fashion designer that has his own company thats named
      “Casquette”. When I did an interview with him I wanted to know what it
      meant and why choose that name for his brand. His response was “Its French
      for caps, and it was my cousins idea.” He spends most of his free time
      creating and gathering new ideas for his hats that he creates by hand.
      Seeing the process of him make hats is impressive because he does it all
      by himself. He has an art room where he has his own workstation to create
      his hats. Anthonie is from Bronx, New York but created his Casquette brand
      while in Albuquerque, New Mexico while attending the University of New
      Mexico. He started making a name for himself out there by making hats and
      selling them to people. He would gain a lot of attention by hosting his
      own fashion shows and art events along with supporting other local artists
      by giving them vendors. His first fashion show called “Little Black Dress”
      which was an all-black affair. He asked the artist to create pieces using
      only or predominantly the color black. This allowed other artists on
      campus to showcase their art as well and allowed other artists on campus
      to network and make money through their art. Over the course of his
      fashion design career, he has made multiple events and has been able have
      his hats showcased by the likes of rappers and singers like Cio Leroy,
      Blue face, P.N.B Rock, Jada Kiss, and Fabolous. Even though its been 7
      years since he first started making hats, he feels he only scratched the
      surface of his fashion journey.
