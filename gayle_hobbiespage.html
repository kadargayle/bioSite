      I’ve known Anthonie since I was a freshman in college. He wanted to pursue
      acting for fun and possibly a career. I wanted to be a screenwriter and
      director as a career. We both have love for arts, music, and basketball so
      we spent time together talking about all those things. We had similar
      hobbies, when I went to his dorm and saw his artbook, immediately I knew
      he was a talented person because he can draw really well. It was my
      sophomore year and his junior year when he started making hats. I’ve
      watched him create his first fashion show and have a great turnout of what
      seemed to be like 200 people at least that came to see the show. It was
      very impressive for it being his first show. His dedication had lead to
      others supporting and helping him along the way. He started making a name
      for himself in Albuquerque and not just on campus at the University of New
      Mexico. By the time it was junior year many people started buying his hats
      all over campus and he would make custom made hats for my friends. People
      would share it all over social media and spread the word on how to get
      custom made hats by Anthonie. It was cool because they actually are high
      quality hats for the same price of the ones we normally get at the big
      corporate stores. As we went through college together I saw that his hobby
      of making art has turned into a business.
